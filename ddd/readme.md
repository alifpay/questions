Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a development philosophy defined by Eric Evans in his seminal work Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software (Addison-Wesley Professional, 2003). DDD is an approach to software development that enables teams to effectively manage the construction and maintenance of software for complex problem domains.

A problem domain refers to the subject area for which you are building software. DDD stresses the need to focus on the domain above anything else when working on creating software for large-scale and complex business systems. Experts in the problem domain work with the development team to focus on the areas of the domain that are useful to be able to produce valuable software. For example, when writing software for the health industry to record patient treatment, it is not important to learn to become a doctor. What is important to understand is the terminology of the health industry, how different departments view patients and care, what information doctors gather, and what they do with it.
