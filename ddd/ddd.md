Domain-Driven Design

DDD is a ubiquitous language in a bounded context.

A bounded context is this sort of relatively small boundary where your program code is. Your application code is within this boundary. All of it. 100% of a single application. Or if you want to say service, it’s within there.

The ubiquitous language is ubiquitous within that boundary. And the team lives within that boundary. And the code lives within that boundary. And all conversations that you have about the model, all learning that you have about what’s in this context, in the model, in this context, that is why it’s ubiquitous. It is ubiquitous, completely permeates everything within the context, including conversations that you have as people.

All the learning, everything that you’re doing, you’re starting to speak a language. And you’re starting to make a language. And then when you write the code to implement this language, you are making the code look as close as possible to the human conversations that you have. And the human conversations are between not just developers, and you don’t just have a business analyst coming over and handing you these use cases or specification documents, and say code it up. It’s like you’re really having conversations with the exact people who are very knowledgeable about the area of expertise that you’re working in. And so they’re called domain experts. Or I just like to say business experts.

One definition of domain is a sphere of knowledge. It’s all driven by that sphere of knowledge that you continue to develop. So it’s all about conversation learning and then improving the code.

Doing DDD very well is more expensive than not doing it. And so you don’t want to invest that way everywhere. You’re not going to have that level of conversation and iteration on things that’s just not that important. So you buy what you can, and what you buy is called a generic subdomain. What you’re developing on the other end, is a core domain. And then in between that, you have something called a supporting subdomain. And a supporting subdomain is something you probably can’t buy, almost never. But you also don’t want to invest a lot in it, but you can’t create the core domain without having this sort of helper, but you also don’t want to mix this code in with the core, because it’s not the same model. And so you separate all these models. And so you have this core domain, or core subdomain. So if there’s a domain that you’re working in, as in a problem space that has a solution, then you have various subdomains within that, and those subdomains roughly mapped to bounded context.

Why DDD Can be Expensive

DDD is expensive because you are really experimenting and having a lot of conversations. And you’re bringing business experts in to be side-by-side with you at certain times. Or you go to them. And so you’re taking their time. There are certain points in the project where they have to be involved for several hours at a time. And then you’re not going to be right.

Maybe naming things well doesn’t matter in the generic place or maybe not even so much in the supporting place, but in the core, it absolutely matters. And so it takes time to think of those things and experiment with them and decide. Is this good? Or is it good enough now?

Why Developers Need to Know DDD

Programmers, if they really want to have a strategic impact on the business, then they will be involved with the business experts, and find where investment needs to be made to innovate.
DDD Most Important Thing

Programmers have to come out of their cubicles. Innovative software development doesn’t happen with one person in a cubicle with great ideas. And you just keep bringing them pizza or ramen every day and noodle bowls or whatever. And they just keep eating and churning out this incredible code. Because it’s not just even about code. Anybody can write code. It’s about what the code accomplishes. And if the code accomplishes something innovative, great!

There aren’t too many single individuals, even if they’re great coders, who are just off the top of their head, or even after thinking for a long time, really innovative about business things. And so we have that sort of actually symbiotic need to be engaged with the business, and the business with developers.

If software is eating the world, and it is even more so now than it was before, you better learn how to innovate.

If you still consider software a cost center in your corporation, and if that mentality lingers for very much longer, you’re history.

Take all those people who’ve been pushing papers for decades and make them business experts. They know this stuff. So it’s not like you just fire them.

How to Start with DDD

You just have to start somewhere.

DDD is not about coding. It is, but it’s not initially about coding.

You can use the pattern and not even get anywhere near the value that you get by having conversations with business people about these.

You have to understand the strategic modeling tools first, but those won’t do you much good at all, unless you’re having conversations with business experts.
